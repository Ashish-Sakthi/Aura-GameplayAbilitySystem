1. Setting Up Input (In Editor)

        1. First, create an **Input Action** (e.g., "IA_Fireball")
           - This represents a physical input (like pressing '1' on keyboard)
        
        2. Create an **Input Config Data Asset**:
           - This connects Input Actions to Gameplay Tags
           - Example setup:
        
        Input Action: IA_Fireball
             Input Tag: "Ability.Skill.Fireball"
        
        
        3. Create your **Ability Blueprint**:
           - Inherit from AuraGameplayAbility
           - Set its StartupInputTag to match the Input Tag (e.g., "Ability.Skill.Fireball")


2. The Flow (What Happens When You Press a Button)

        Let's say you press the key bound to "Fireball":
        
        1. Input Detection**:
           - The game detects you pressed the key bound to "IA_Fireball"
        
        2. Tag Matching**:
           - The system looks up what tag is associated with "IA_Fireball"
           - Finds the tag "Ability.Skill.Fireball"
        
        3. Controller Response**:
           - PlayerController receives this input
           - Calls either AbilityInputTagPressed, Released, or Held
        
        4. Ability System**:
           - The AbilitySystemComponent looks for abilities with matching tags
           - When it finds a match, it activates that ability

3. Simple Example

Let's say you want to create a Fireball ability:

1. **In the Editor**:

1. Create Input Action "IA_Fireball"
2. In Input Config Data Asset:
   - Input Action: IA_Fireball
   - Input Tag: "Ability.Skill.Fireball"
3. In Fireball Ability Blueprint:
   - Set StartupInputTag = "Ability.Skill.Fireball"



2. What Happens When You Press the Key**:

1. Press key bound to Fireball
2. System sees "IA_Fireball" was triggered
3. Looks up tag "Ability.Skill.Fireball"
4. Finds Fireball ability with matching tag
5. Activates Fireball ability



 4. Key Points for Beginners

1. Tags are Like Names**:
   - Think of tags as name tags that connect everything together
   - The same tag must be used in both the Input Config and the Ability

2. Three Input States**:
   - Pressed (when you first press the key)
   - Held (while you keep the key down)
   - Released (when you let go of the key)

3. The Chain of Events**:
```
Physical Input → Input Action → Gameplay Tag        →    Ability
(Key Press)     (IA_Fireball)  (Ability.Skill.Fireball) (Fireball Ability)
```
